# Hypothesis Testing Examples

This repository provides practical examples and step-by-step implementations of hypothesis testing using Python. It is designed to help users understand the core concepts of hypothesis testing and how they can be applied to real-world datasets.

## About
Hypothesis testing is a fundamental aspect of inferential statistics that allows us to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. This repository provides:

- Examples of different types of hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests).
- Practical scenarios where hypothesis testing is used.
- Easy-to-follow Python scripts for implementation.

## Features
- Step-by-step guides for hypothesis testing.
- Implementations of one-sample, two-sample, paired-sample tests, and more.
- Clear and concise code written in Python.
- Explanations and comments for better understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use the scripts in this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Recommended version: **Python 3.7 or higher**.

You will also need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SerdarHSVR/Hypothesis-Testing-Examples.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Hypothesis-Testing-Examples
   ```
3. Install the dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Examples
This repository includes examples of:

- **One-Sample t-Test**: Test whether the mean of a single group differs from a known value.
- **Two-Sample t-Test**: Compare the means of two independent groups.
- **Paired-Sample t-Test**: Compare the means of two related groups.
- **Chi-Square Test**: Test for independence between categorical variables.
- **ANOVA**: Analyze the variance between multiple groups.

Each example is located in its respective folder with a detailed explanation and code implementation.

## Usage
1. Explore the `examples/` directory to find the hypothesis test you are interested in.
2. Open the corresponding Python file to view the implementation.
3. Run the script in your local Python environment:
   ```bash
   python example_file.py
   ```
4. Follow the comments in the script to understand the steps and modify the code as needed.
